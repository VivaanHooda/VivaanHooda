I am a 17-year-old high school student in Year 13 at Primus Public School in Bangalore, India. 
Currently, I am preparing for multiple Indian Engineering entrance exams. I am interested in subjects like Physics and Mathematics. 
Beyond academia, I find fulfilment in activities such as Cricket, Tennis, and programming. 
My long-term goal is to pursue a degree in Computer Science/Electronics, a path that aligns with my aspirations and interests.
